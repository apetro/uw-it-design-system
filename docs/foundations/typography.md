Use the type scale to apply consistent typographic design.

### Typefaces

The UW Madison Design System uses exclusively `Roboto`. The type was chosen
because it is flexible, accessible and free to use, which is necessary to
accommodate projects across UWâ€™s campus.

+ Primary Font: Roboto
+ Fallback Fonts: Helvetica, Arial
+ Title Font: Verlag

### General Guidelines

+ Never end a header or label with a period (.)
+ Only use a period (.) for sentences, paragraphs, and copy.
+ Avoid use of all caps wherever possible.
